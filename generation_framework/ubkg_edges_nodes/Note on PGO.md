# Note on PGO
PGO is a precursor SAB for GENCODE. 

The Pseudogene (PGO) ontology is available as a RDF file in [NCBO BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/pseudo). 
It has not been updated since 2008.

I downloaded PFO from BioPortal as owlapi.xrdf, renamed it pgo.xrdf, and then
stored the RDF file as local edge/node file. The script converts
the file to OWLNETS format using PheKnowLator.
